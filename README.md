Voice-Over Organizer is a Google Sheets + Apps Script workspace for voice actors and audio teams. It scans two Drive folders (Voice Projects & Auditions), builds tidy trackers, and keeps them in sync. New roles dropped into your “Voice Projects” folder automatically mark the matching audition as Booked; when a role moves to Past, the audition becomes Submitted. The sidebar UI gives you top-tabs navigation, quick filters, audition chips + instant search, KPIs/insights, bulk status/link updates, and export to CSV/PDF—no coding required.

Highlights

Drive-powered: scans your Voice Projects & Auditions folders (auto-sync via Drive for desktop).

Auto status mapping: Current → Booked, Past → Submitted (customizable; never overwrites Passed).

Fast filters & search: character/folder/file filters for Voice; status chips + quick search for Auditions.

Bulk actions: apply final links and statuses by character and optional file selection.

Insights: KPIs (totals, recent adds) and recent activity across both sheets.

Exports: one-click CSV (visible rows) and summary PDF.

Performance-minded: batch writes, block row-hiding, safe hyperlink handling.

Easy setup: paste the script, set two Drive folder IDs, click “Run initial scans.”

Great for: voice actors, producers, indie teams, and anyone tracking auditions → bookings in Google Drive.
